			<p>Students can enter courses at different levels depending upon their previous language learning background. Students can continue studying a language learned at high school and also take up a new language from scratch. Many Narrabundah students study two or more languages.</p>
			<p> Beginning Courses are designed for students with no prior knowledge of a language. Continuing Courses are for students who have completed three or four years of a language at high school or have some skills in a language spoken at home. Advanced Courses are for native speakers or other students with considerable skills in the chosen language. Students who have spent time in the country where the language is spoken usually enrol in the advanced course where they can further improve on their skills. Literature is also studied in most of these courses.</p>

				<h2>Chinese</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Mandarin is a group of related varieties of Chinese spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. The group includes the Beijing dialect, the basis of Standard Chinese, which is also referred to as "Mandarin". Because most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as the Northern dialects. When the Mandarin group is taken as one language, as is often done in academic literature, it has more native speakers (nearly a billion) than any other language.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>French</h2>
				<div>
					<p>French is the official language in 29 countries. It is spoken as a first language in France, southern Belgium, western Switzerland, Monaco, certain parts of Canada and the United States, and by various communities elsewhere. As of 2015, 40% of the francophone population are in Europe, 35% in sub-Saharan Africa, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East, 8% in the Americas, and 1% in Asia and Oceania.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>German</h2>
				<div>
					<p>One of the major languages of the world, German is the first language of about 95 million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the European Union. German also is the third most widely taught foreign language in both the US (after Spanish and French) and the EU (after English and French), the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the third most widely used language on websites (after English and Russian).</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Hindi</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Hindi is a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language. Hindi is an official language of the Union of India, and the lingua franca of the Hindi belt languages. In the 2001 Indian census, 258 million people in India reported Hindi to be their native language and is the fourth-most natively spoken language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish and English.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Indonesian</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Indonesian is the official language of Indonesia. It is a standardized register of Malay, an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries. Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the world. Of its large population, the majority speak Indonesian, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the world.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Italian</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Italian is a Romance language, the closest to Latin in terms of vocabulary. It is an official language in Italy, Switzerland, San Marino, Vatican City and Istria (in Slovenia and Croatia). Italian used to have official status in Albania, Malta and Monaco, all countries where it is still widely spoken, and in former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa, regions where the language plays a significant role in various sectors. Italian is spoken by large expatriate communities in the Americas and by small minorities in areas such as Crimea, Corsica and Montenegro.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Japanese</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Japanese is an East Asian language spoken by about 125 million speakers, primarily in Japan, where it is the national language. It is a member of the Japonic (or Japanese-Ryukyuan) language family, whose relation to other language groups, particularly to Korean and the suggested Altaic language family, is debated.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Korean</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Korean is the official language of the Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with different official forms used in each nation-state; it is also one of the two official languages in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of the People's Republic of China. Approximately 80 million people speak Korean worldwide.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Spanish</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Spanish is a Romance language that originated in the Castile region of Spain and today has hundreds of millions of native-speakers across the world.</p>
					<p>Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empirein the 5th century. It was first documented in central-northern Iberia in the 9th century and gradually spread with the expansion of the Kingdom of Castile into central and southern Iberia. Beginning in the early 16th century, Spanish was taken to the colonies of the Spanish Empire, most notably to the Americas, as well as territories in Africa, Oceania and the Philippines. </p>
				</div>
				<h2>Translating and Interpreting Skills</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Translating and Interpreting Skills is a course in interpreting and translating and aims to give students with a native language other than English, the opportunity to improve their language skills through interpreter/translator techniques. Further, this is an opportunity to develop adult literacy in a community language. Thus the home language of a student can be more readily offered as a skill to an employer.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>ESL and EAP</h2>
				<div>
					<p>English for academic purposes (EAP) entails training students, usually in a higher education setting, to use language appropriately for study. It is one of the most common forms of English for specific purposes(ESP). An EAP program focuses instruction on skills required to perform in an English-speaking academic context across core subject areas generally encountered in a university setting.</p>
